:information_source: This project was used for 5 years to serve as a base image for the [Galaxy Docker](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable) project. After 5 years we decided to deprecate the support for "Galaxy Tool dependencies", hence this image is obsolete and from 19.05 on we will not use it anymore.


# Docker Galaxy Requirements

This Docker image contains all Galaxy requirements that are needed for installing tools from the Tool Shed.
It serves as base image for https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable.
